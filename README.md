so we might categorize these things.

need internet versus no internet.

if no internet, we close those online apps.

if has internet, we first check if it is properly working. if it can automatically kill previous session then nothing to worry about. only do this once if status has changed to internet connected.

if do not require internet, like temp-throttle, we only do it once.

last, switch to target workspace(blank) since we will do things there.# restore_sessions
